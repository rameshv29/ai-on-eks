# Multi-Agent System Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a multi-agent system using Strands and AWS Bedrock. The system consists of three main components:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates interactions between agents and handles user requests
2. **Weather Agent**: Provides weather information for specific locations and dates
3. **Citymapper Agent**: Provides travel planning information and recommendations

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed AWS Region Error

The citymapper agent was failing with `botocore.exceptions.NoRegionError: You must specify a region.` We fixed this by explicitly setting the region and endpoint URL in the `agent_state_manager.py` file.

### 2. Created Missing Files

We created the missing `agent_fastapi.py` file in the orchestrator directory to handle API requests.

### 3. Implemented Error Handling

We improved error handling in the API endpoints to return helpful error messages instead of 500 errors.

### 4. Added Mock Agent for Testing

We implemented a mock agent for testing when AWS Bedrock credentials are not properly configured.

### 5. Created Documentation

We created comprehensive documentation for the multi-agent system:
- README.md: Overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md: Common issues and solutions
- .env.example: Example environment variables

## Testing

We tested the system by:
1. Starting all services with Docker Compose
2. Testing the orchestrator API with curl
3. Verifying that the system returns appropriate responses

## Next Steps

1. **AWS Deployment**: Deploy the system to AWS using EKS
2. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for production
3. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring and logging for production
4. **Testing**: Create comprehensive test suite
5. **Documentation**: Add API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
